# Bangla-AI-Voice-Assistant
Taking Bangla voice as input and giving Bangla voice as output is what it does.

This project involves using Google Speech-To-Text, OpenAIâ€™s Whisper Model, Google Bard API (Reverse Engineered), Google Text-To-Speech, BanglaTTS (PyTorch, Aksharamukha, Silero Models).
It also uses undetected_chromedriver (a special selenium wrapper).
